# llSPS-INT-1566-Predicting-Life-Expectancy-using-Machine-Learning

1. The purpose of the project is to design a model for predicting Life Expectancy rate of a country given various features such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given.


2. In this project, we have to create a new model based on the data provided to evaluate the life expectancy. The data offers a timeframe from 2015 to 2022. The output algorithms have been used to test if they can maintain their accuracy in predicting the life expectancy for data they haven't been trained. Following algorithms have been used: 
** Linear Regression 
** Ridge Regression 
** Lasso Regression 
** Elastic Net Regression 
** Linear Regression with Polynomic features
** Decision Tree Regression
** Random Forest Regression
World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries. The data-sets are made available to public for the purpose of health data analysis. The data-set related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from United Nation website.
